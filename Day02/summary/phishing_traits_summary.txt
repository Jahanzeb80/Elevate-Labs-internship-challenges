Phishing Traits Summary – Day 02 Task

After analyzing the sample email claiming to offer a virtual research assistant position at UC Berkeley, the following phishing traits were identified:

1. **Suspicious Sender Address**
   - The sender’s address is jobs@ucberkeley-secure.com, which mimics the official university domain (berkeley.edu) but is not legitimate. This is a common spoofing method.

2. **Missing or Forged Email Headers**
   - Simulated email headers indicate SPF failure, missing DKIM, and no DMARC policy — all signs of poor authentication and likely spoofing.

3. **No Legitimate Contact Channels**
   - The email asks the recipient to text a phone number (510-216-7076), avoiding official channels and pushing the conversation into a less secure medium.

4. **Urgent Language**
   - The phrase “urgently needs undergraduates” is used to create a sense of urgency and rush the reader into responding quickly.

5. **Indirect Requests**
   - The email withholds job details unless the user replies first, which is suspicious and commonly used in scams to gather personal data.

6. **Requests for Non-Job-Related Tasks**
   - Asking the recipient to look up prices for office supplies (laptop, printer, date stamp) is irrelevant and a red flag. This is often part of a purchase scam or setup for future fraud.

7. **Poor Grammar and Informal Language**
   - Awkward phrasing like “remote chores” and inconsistent formatting reduce the professionalism expected from a top university.

8. **No Links or Attachments, But Still Dangerous**
   - Even without links or attachments, the email is dangerous because it uses social engineering tactics (urgency, impersonation, phone contact) to exploit trust.

**Conclusion:**
This email is a well-disguised phishing attempt. It impersonates a respected institution, uses urgency, requests personal info, and avoids official communication channels to manipulate the target. It should be reported and ignored.
